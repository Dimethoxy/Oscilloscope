# Oscilloscope Project (Work in Progress)

This repository contains the initial stages of our oscilloscope project, aimed at developing a highly optimized, high-detail oscilloscope for use in various other projects. \
As this is a work in progress, many features are incomplete or under active development.

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project include:
- **High Optimization:** Ensuring the oscilloscope runs efficiently on minimal hardware.
- **High Detail:** Capturing and displaying waveforms with high precision and clarity.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrating the oscilloscope into other Dimethoxy projects for real-time signal analysis.

## Current Status

- Basic waveform capture implemented
- Preliminary UI design in place
- Initial testing phase started

## Planned Features

- Zoom in/out functionality for detailed waveform analysis
- Beat sync to align with musical or rhythmic signals

## Getting Started

While the project is still under construction, you can clone the repository and experiment with the current features. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue to build out this tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/oscilloscope.git
